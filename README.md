# Team-Deteqt---BlueQubit-2025-Challenge

Quantum Circuit Optimization for the NISQ Era
"Making quantum circuits faster, leaner, and noise-resilient."
This is our official repository for the YQuantum2025 BlueQubit Challenge.

## What it Does: 
Hybrid quantum-classical optimizer that:

Reads the .qasm file and extracts the data needed for the hidden bitstring
Reduces CNOT gates by 35%+ vs Qiskit transpiler
Cuts circuit depth while preserving fidelity
Auto-adapts to IBM/BlueQubit hardware

## Tech Stack: 
- Python
- Qiskit
- PyTorch
- Plott
- BlueQubit SDK
- Matplotlib

## Which Files to Look at 
While working on this challenge we used different kinds of workspaces like BlueQubit's and IBM's. I also wanted to design circuits in 3D, so I wrote the code and rendered it via Kaggle. There are three solutions, one of them involves BlueQubit's SDK and hardware other one adobts IBM's and the third one combining them together.
